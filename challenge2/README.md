# Challenge 2

Create a service that publish events to a Kafka topic. Create another service that reads events from Kafka. Host all of it in AKS.

# Tools
We need Docker Desktop 
```powershell
 winget install Docker.DockerDesktop
```

# Run Kafka locally

I plan to use [Strimzi Kafka](https://strimzi.io/).

I use Docker Compose to start Kafka.

```powershell
docker-compose up
``` 




# Create Publisher Service

# Create Subscriber Service

# Create Containers for services

# Create ACR and AKS 

# Deploy Kafka and Services
